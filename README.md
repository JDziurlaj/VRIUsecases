Democracy Fund VRI Use Cases and Reference Code Samples

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in collaboration with election officials and technologists, has created the Voter Records Interchange common data format (VRICDF) for data exchanges of voter records. State adoption of the VRICDF will allow for simplified automated processes in online voter record management and better voter list maintenance and accuracy. The ultimate goal of this engagement is to enhance the utility, timeliness, and sustainability of the VRICDF. 

The core of this engagement is the articulation of a series of use cases that are critical to the further adoption of the CDF.  These use cases are described in narrative form, in use case models, and reference code implementations below.  

The use cases are intended to augment existing models created by NIST and its partner entities for the receipt and validation of voter records.
